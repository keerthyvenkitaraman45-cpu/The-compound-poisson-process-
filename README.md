# The-compound-poisson-process-
This project implements an interactive R Shiny application to explore the behavior of a Compound Poisson Process with Exponential jumps. The app allows users to simulate the process, visualize the distribution of the accumulated sum  𝑆 ( 𝑡 ) S(t), and study how the parameters influence the model.
